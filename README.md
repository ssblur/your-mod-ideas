# One Billion Things
*A Collection of your mod ideas*

## What is One Billion Things?

One Billion Things is a mod that collects various suggestions provided through
[YouTube comments](http://yt.blur.lol) 
and [my Discord server](http://dc.blur.lol).

Most included features are either non-intrusive or can be disabled via
a game rule, and most are disabled by default.
This is a showcase mod more than anything, so it isn't built to be 
usable outright in survival.

## Questions

**Can you add [idea]?**

Yep! That's the point, actually!
Feel free to drop by [my Discord server](http://dc.blur.lol) and leave
any suggestions you have in #your-mod-ideas.
I might not get to it right away, but I love working on these so chances
are I'll at least give it a good once-over.

**You didn't do my idea!**

Sorry! I might not get to all of them, and might not implement some ideas
at all if they are inappropriate for YouTube or particularly difficult
to implement.

If you're not sure, feel free to ask, though I'll usually let you know
up front if something is a no-go.

**I like [idea]. Can you make it into a separate mod?**

While I will consider it for particularly popular ideas, this mod is also
licensed under the WTFPL, which is provides explicit, irrevocable freedom
to do whatever you want with parts of this repository that aren't otherwise
affected by someone else's license.

Basically, feel free to yoink whatever features you want and put them
into your own mod if you want.

**I found a bug!**

I actually do maintain this, in spite of its premise!
